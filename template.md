Note: this is a discussion daft of the grant program, subject to approval of the Magma Core Foundation Governing Board.

# Template for Submission

Please create an issue in the grant repo and use this submission template for an easier submission build out

## Project:

Project Name

## Elevator Pitch:

This is your opportunity to convince the community of the impact and importance of your ask. This should be a brief description of the project that captures both the value and deliverable in a few sentences (or a tweet) and why it's needed or matters.

## Total ask:

This is the amount you're requesting for the grant, not necessarily the total budget.

## Sponsoring Codeowner

Each proposal submitted must have a sponsoring Codeowner (as defined in the [Magma Technical Charter](https://github.com/magma/Governance/blob/main/CHARTER.md)).

## Contact information:

Please provide your legal name and a link to the submitted issue to grants@magmacore.org. This will streamline the contract process and KYC. A lack of this information will delay the contract.

Team or Project website: (optional)

Team or projects social: (optional)

Code Repos of team or key applicants:

## Project Details:

We expect a clearly articulated final deliverable for the project.

If the project utilizes legacy or other codebases, please specify this and link to applicable repos. In addition list any specific IP licenses you are utilizing.

Where relevant, please include mockups/designs of any UI/hardware components, and API specifications of the core functionality.

It is often helpful to include an overview of the tech stack to be used, including any required dependencies. Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture or schematics to be deployed within or as the MVP is even better.

## Roadmap:

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones.

Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the expected functionality and how it can be validated.

Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered. The level of detail must be enough to later verify that the project meets the specification.
